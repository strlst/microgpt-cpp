# micro_gpt

This project is a C++ recreation of karpathy's `microgpt.py`, in order to gain an intuition into the process of implementing forward and backward passes of a GPT-like language model, evaluate performance and perhaps most importantly, to have some fun.

As of yet not completed.
Since this project reflects a personal desire to learn, it is written entirely by human hands.

Original Python implementation taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/8627fe009c40f57531cb18360106ce95) (made by Andrej Karpathy).

For file downloads, the excellent and simple single-file header-only library [provided by yhirose](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/) is used.
